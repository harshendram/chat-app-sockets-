# Chat App - Because Exams Are Boring ðŸŽ­

## "I got bored with sem exams, so I did this."

Yeah, that's exactly how this happened. Instead of cramming last-minute formulas, I ended up deep-diving into **Socket.IO** and real-time communication. One moment I was flipping through textbooks, the next, I was building a chat app that actually does something cool.

So hereâ€™s my take on making the internet a slightly chattier place. Real-time, instant, and kinda fun. Hit me up if you vibe with it.
